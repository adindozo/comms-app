Here's a quick guide on how to get started:

1. First, you'll need to clone this repository to your local machine. Simply run the command git clone https://github.com/adindozo/comms-app in your terminal.

2. Next, navigate to the project directory and run npm install to install all the necessary dependencies.

3. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server on port 8080 by typing npm run devStart.

*One thing to note is that this app requires a .env file for it to work properly. Unfortunately, this file is not included in the repository for security reasons. If you want the .env file, you can contact me at adin.dozo1@outlook.com.
